The `[[nodiscard]]` attribute in C++17 serves a crucial role in improving code safety and clarity by signaling to the compiler that the return value of a function or the result of a constructor should not be ignored. If a caller discards such a marked return value, the compiler is encouraged to issue a warning, thereby preventing potential bugs and misuse. 

## Key Usefulness of [[nodiscard]]: 

- **Error Prevention**: It helps catch common programming errors where a function's return value, which may indicate a status, error code, resource ownership, or a new state, is inadvertently discarded. Examples include functions returning error codes that should be checked, or functions that return ownership of a dynamically allocated resource. 
- **Clarity and Intent**: It clearly communicates the intent of the function or constructor to other developers. If a function is marked `[[nodiscard]]`, it signifies that its primary purpose is to produce a meaningful result that the caller is expected to utilize. 
- **Resource Management**: In cases where a function returns a resource (e.g., a smart pointer, a lock), `[[nodiscard]]` ensures that the caller explicitly handles or stores that resource, preventing resource leaks or unmanaged access. 
- **Disambiguation**: For functions that might be mistaken for "in-place" operations but actually return a modified copy or a new object, `[[nodiscard]]` clarifies this behavior. For example, a reverse() method on a List that returns a new reversed list, rather than modifying the original in place, benefits from `[[nodiscard]]`. 
- **Constructors and Resource Acquisition**: Applying `[[nodiscard]]` to constructors, especially those that acquire resources (like `std::unique_lock` or `std::unique_ptr`), ensures that the constructed object, and thus the acquired resource, is not immediately discarded without proper handling. 

In essence, `[[nodiscard]]` acts as a compile-time safeguard, promoting robust code by highlighting situations where ignoring a return value is likely a mistake and should be addressed. 

AI responses may include mistakes.

This simple attribute makes APIs safer and communicates intent clearly to the user. Since C++20, you can also provide a reason string, like `[[nodiscard("Ignoring this return value may lead to a resource leak")]]`, to give more context in the compiler warning.

### Nuance 1: Functions Returning a Status or Error Code

A common bug is calling a function that indicates success/failure and forgetting to check the result.

*Problem: The boolean return value is ignored.*
```cpp
bool PerformOperation() {
  // ... does something ...
  return false; // Indicate failure.
}

void Run() {
  PerformOperation(); // Oops, didn't check if it failed.
}
````

*Fix: Add `[[nodiscard]]` to force the caller to acknowledge the result.*

```cpp
[[nodiscard]] bool PerformOperation() {
  // ... does something ...
  return false; // Indicate failure.
}

void Run() {
  if (!PerformOperation()) { // Compiler would warn if result were ignored.
    // Handle failure...
  }
}
```

### Nuance 2: Factory Functions or Functions Returning RAII Objects

Ignoring the result of a function that returns an RAII object (like a `std::unique_ptr` or a file handle) almost always results in a resource leak.

*Problem: The created `Widget` is immediately destroyed and leaked.*

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<Widget> CreateWidget() {
  return std::make_unique<Widget>();
}

void Setup() {
  CreateWidget(); // Bug: The returned unique_ptr is discarded, leaking Widget.
}
```

*Fix: `[[nodiscard]]` warns the user they've made a mistake.*

```cpp
[[nodiscard]] std::unique_ptr<Widget> CreateWidget() {
  return std::make_unique<Widget>();
}

void Setup() {
  // The compiler would warn about the discarded result here.
  // Correct usage:
  auto widget = CreateWidget();
  // Use widget...
}
```

### Nuance 3: Applying `[[nodiscard]]` to a Class or Struct

If all functions returning an object of a certain type should be `[[nodiscard]]`, you can apply the attribute directly to the class/struct definition. This is perfect for custom RAII types or error types.

*Problem: A function returning a non-obvious handle type can be ignored.*

```cpp
struct ScopedHandle {
  int handle_;
  // ... RAII logic ...
};

ScopedHandle GetHandle() {
  return ScopedHandle{42};
}

void UseHandle() {
  GetHandle(); // The returned handle is immediately destroyed.
}
```

*Fix: Mark the entire struct as `[[nodiscard]]`.*

```cpp
// Now, any function returning a ScopedHandle is implicitly nodiscard.
[[nodiscard]] struct ScopedHandle {
  int handle_;
  // ... RAII logic ...
};

ScopedHandle GetHandle() { // Implicitly [[nodiscard]]
  return ScopedHandle{42};
}

void UseHandle() {
  // Compiler warns here because GetHandle() returns a [[nodiscard]] type.
  // Correct usage:
  auto h = GetHandle();
}
```

### Nuance 4: Builder-style "Set" Methods that Return a Reference

Methods on a builder object that return `*this` to allow chaining should also be `[[nodiscard]]` to prevent confusing `obj.SetFoo()` with a function that modifies `obj` by reference. This is especially true if the `Set` method returns a *new* object instead of modifying in-place.

*Problem: Ambiguity in whether the object is modified or a new one is returned.*

```cpp
class CircleBuilder {
 public:
  CircleBuilder WithRadius(float r) {
    radius_ = r;
    return *this;
  }
 private:
  float radius_;
};

// Caller might think this modifies 'b', but it does nothing.
CircleBuilder b;
b.WithRadius(5.0); // The temporary returned object is discarded.
```

*Fix: `[[nodiscard]]` clarifies that the return value is the intended result.*

```cpp
class CircleBuilder {
 public:
  [[nodiscard]] CircleBuilder WithRadius(float r) {
    radius_ = r;
    return *this;
  }
 private:
  float radius_;
};

// Correct usage is to chain or re-assign.
auto b2 = CircleBuilder{}.WithRadius(5.0);

// With the fix, this line would produce a warning:
// b.WithRadius(5.0);
```
