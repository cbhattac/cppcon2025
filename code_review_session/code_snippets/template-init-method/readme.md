### Class: Use template method to initialize if it is not possible to initialize fully in constructor.

When constructing an object, it's generally best practice to ensure the object is fully initialized and in a valid state by the end of its constructor. However, there are scenarios where full initialization within the constructor isn't feasible or ideal. These situations often involve:

1.  **Dependencies on virtual functions:** Calling virtual functions from a constructor can lead to unexpected behavior because the most derived class's version of the function won't be called.
2.  **Complex initialization logic:** If the initialization involves multiple steps, potential failures, or resource acquisition that might fail, it can clutter the constructor.
3.  **Two-phase construction (historical reasons or specific patterns):** Sometimes, a "two-phase" construction pattern is used, where an object is first constructed, and then an `Initialize()` method is called. This can be error-prone if the `Initialize()` method is forgotten.

The "template method" pattern (in this context, referring to a static factory method that internally handles initialization) provides a more robust way to manage such situations. By using a static `Create` method (often templated to allow for derived types), you can encapsulate the initialization logic and guarantee that any object returned by this method is fully initialized.
